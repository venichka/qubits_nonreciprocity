	abstract = {A promising approach to merge atomic systems with scalable photonics has emerged recently, which consists of trapping cold atoms near tapered nanoﬁbers. Here, we describe a novel technique to achieve strong, coherent coupling between a single atom and photon in such a system. Our approach makes use of collective enhancement effects, which allow a lattice of atoms to form a high-ﬁnesse cavity within the ﬁber. We show that a specially designated ‘impurity’ atom within the cavity can experience strongly enhanced interactions with single photons in the ﬁber. Under realistic conditions, a ‘strong coupling’ regime can be reached, wherein it becomes feasible to observe vacuum Rabi oscillations between the excited impurity atom and a single cavity quantum. This technique can form the basis for a scalable quantum information network using atom–nanoﬁber systems.},

However, the realization of integrated nanophotonic systems requires the coupling of emitters to optical cavities and resonators. In this work, we demonstrate hybrid systems in which quantum emitters in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are deterministically coupled to highquality plasmonic nanocavity arrays. The plasmonic nanoparticle arrays oﬀer a high-quality, low-loss cavity in the same spectral range as the quantum emitters in hBN. The coupled emitters exhibit enhanced emission rates and reduced ﬂuorescence lifetimes, consistent with Purcell enhancement in the weak coupling regime. Our results provide the foundation for a versatile approach for achieving scalable, integrated hybrid systems based on low-loss plasmonic nanoparticle arrays and 2D materials.},

            Understanding strong cooperative optical responses in dense and cold atomic ensembles is vital for fundamental science and emerging quantum technologies. Methodologies for characterizing light-induced quantum effects in such systems, however, are still lacking. Here we unambiguously identify significant quantum many-body effects, robust to position fluctuations and strong dipole–dipole interactions, in light scattered from planar atomic ensembles by comparing full quantum simulations with a semiclassical model neglecting quantum fluctuations. We find pronounced quantum effects at high atomic densities, light close to saturation intensity, and around subradiant resonances. Such conditions also maximize spin–spin correlations and entanglement between atoms, revealing the microscopic origin of light-induced quantum effects. In several regimes of interest, our approximate model reproduces light transmission remarkably well, permitting analysis of otherwise numerically inaccessible large ensembles, in which we observe many-body analogues of resonance power broadening, vacuum Rabi splitting, and significant suppression in cooperative reflection from atomic arrays.},

	abstract = {Quantum emitters, in particular, atomic arrays with subwavelength lattice constant, have been proposed to be an ideal platform for study the interplay between photons and electric dipoles. In this work, motivated by the recent experiment [1], we develop a microscopic quantum treatment using annihilation and creation operator of atoms in deep optical lattices. Using a diagrammatic approach on the Keldysh contour, we derive the cooperative scattering of the light and obtain the general formula for the S matrix. We apply our formulism to study two eﬀects beyond previous treatment with spin operators, the eﬀect of fractional ﬁlling and trapping mismatch. Both eﬀects can lead to the imperfectness of atomic mirrors. For the fractional ﬁlling case, we ﬁnd the cooperative linewidth is linear in ﬁlling fraction n. When there is a mismatch between the trapping potentials for atoms in the ground state and the excited state, multiple resonances can appear in the response function. Our results are consistent with existing experiments.},

In this review article we survey recent theoretical studies concerning the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to create quantum many-body systems. Based on recent experimental progress in the fabrication of arrays of interacting micro-cavities and on their coupling to atomic-like structures in several different physical architectures, we review proposals on the realisation of paradigmatic many-body models in such systems, such as the Bose-Hubbard and the anisotropic Heisenberg models. Such arrays of coupled cavities offer interesting properties as simulators of quantum many-body physics, including the full addressability of individual sites and the accessibility of inhomogeneous models.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new theoretical approach for analyzing pump and probe experiments in non-linear acousto-optic systems. In our approach, the effect of coherently pumped polaritons is modeled as providing time-periodic modulation of the system parameters. Within this framework, propagation of the probe pulse is described by the Floquet version of Maxwell's equations and leads to such phenomena as frequency mixing and resonant parametric production of polariton pairs. We analyze light reflection from a slab of insulating material with a strongly excited phonon-polariton mode and obtain analytic expressions for the frequency-dependent reflection coefficient for the probe pulse. Our results are in agreement with recent experiments by Cartella et al. which demonstrated light amplification in resonantly excited SiC insulator. We show that, beyond a critical pumping strength, such systems should exhibit Floquet parametric instability, which corresponds to resonant scattering of the pump polaritons into pairs of finite momentum polaritons. We find that the parametric instability should be achievable in SiC using current experimental techniques and discuss its signatures, including the non-analytic frequency dependence of the reflection coefficient and the probe pulse afterglow. We discuss possible applications of the parametric instability phenomenon and suggest that similar types of instabilities can be present in other photoexcited non-linear systems.},

When probing the sample with a second pulse, we observe parametric optical gain at all wavelengths throughout the reststrahlen band. This effect reflects the amplification of light by phonon-mediated four-wave mixing and, by extension, of optical-phonon fluctuations. Density functional theory calculations clarify aspects of the microscopic mechanism for this phenomenon. The high-frequency dielectric permittivity and the phonon oscillator strength depend quadratically on the lattice coordinate; they oscillate at twice the frequency of the optical field and provide a parametric drive for the lattice mode. Parametric gain in phononic four-wave mixing is a generic mechanism that can be extended to all polar modes of solids, as a means to control the kinetics of phase transitions, to amplify many-body interactions or to control phonon-polariton waves.},

	abstract = {Optical drives at terahertz and mid-infrared frequencies in quantum materials are increasingly used to reveal the nonlinear dynamics of collective modes in correlated many-body systems and their interplay with electromagnetic waves. Recent experiments demonstrated several surprising optical properties of transient states induced by driving, including the appearance of photo-induced edges in the reflectivity in cuprate superconductors, observed both below and above the equilibrium transition temperature. Furthermore, in other driven materials, reflection coefficients larger than unity have been observed. In this paper we demonstrate that unusual optical properties of photoexcited systems can be understood from the perspective of a Floquet system; a system with periodically modulated system parameters originating from pump-induced oscillations of a collective mode. We present a general phenomenological model of reflectivity from Floquet materials, which takes into account parametric generation of excitation pairs. We find a universal phase diagram of drive induced features in reflectivity which evidence a competition between driving and dissipation. To illustrate our general analysis we apply our formalism to two concrete examples motivated by recent experiments: a single plasmon band, which describes Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors, and a phonon-polariton system, which describes upper and lower polaritons in materials such as insulating SiC. Finally we demonstrate that our model can be used to provide an accurate fit to results of phonon-pump - terahertz-probe experiments in the high temperature superconductor \${\textbackslash}rm\{YBa\_2Cu\_3O\_\{6.5\}\}\$. Our model explains the appearance of a pump-induced edge, which is higher in energy than the equilibrium Josephson plasmon edge, even if the interlayer Josephson coupling is suppressed by the pump pulse.},

            In recent years, there has been considerable effort to bring ultracold atoms into the realm of nanophotonics. Nanoscopic dielectric devices offer unprecedented opportunities to engineer novel capabilities for the control of atom–photon interactions. In particular, photonic crystals are periodic dielectric structures that display a photonic bandgap where light cannot propagate and provide a new setting for coherent photon-mediated interactions between atoms with tunable range. Here, we report the initial observation of cooperative atom–atom interactions around the band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide. Our experiment opens the door to fascinating scenarios, such as exploring many-body physics with large spin exchange energies and low dissipation.

Such a trend has inevitably aﬀected the research funding market; thus, large state initiatives are taken that are directly expected to drive the formulation of novel research concepts and the development of quantum device prototypes from sensors and circuitry to quantum memory and repeaters. A fundamental operation behind all these applications is the eﬀective steering of electrons, constituting matter waves, along speciﬁc directions and with certain magnitudes, due to development of various reﬂective and refractive orders. The objective of this study is to optimize the simplest structure that supports such anomalous diﬀraction, namely a quantum metasurface comprising cylindrical rods embedded in suitable crystalline matter. Several highly-performing designs from these minimal setups are proven to work exceptionally as multiport components, employable to a variety of quantum engineering implementations.},

Analyzing their interplay, we identify conditions that yield a nonlinear quantum mirror which coherently splits incident fields into correlated photon-pairs in a single transverse mode, while transmitting single photons unaffected. Such strong photon-photon interactions in the absence of otherwise detrimental photon losses in Rydberg-EIT arrays opens up a promising approach for the generation and manipulation of quantum light, and the exploration of many-body phenomena with interacting photons.},

            Efficient manipulation of quantum states is a key step towards applications in quantum information, quantum metrology, and nonlinear optics. Recently, atomic arrays have been shown to be a promising system for exploring topological quantum optics and robust control of quantum states, where the inherent nonlinearity is included through long-range hoppings. Here we show that a one-dimensional atomic array in a periodic magnetic field exhibits characteristic properties associated with an effective two-dimensional Hofstadter-butterfly-like model. Our work points out super- and sub-radiant topological edge states localized at the boundaries of the atomic array despite featuring long-range interactions, and opens an avenue of exploring an interacting quantum optical platform with synthetic dimensions.},

The chiral interaction between the resonator mode and the QE can break the time-reversal symmetry without the magneto-optical effect. As a result, a nonreciprocal single-photon edge state, band gap and flat band appear. By using such a chiral QE-CROW system, including a finite number of unit cells and working in the nonreciprocal band gap, we achieve frequency-multiplex single-photon circulators with high fidelity and low insertion loss. The chiral QE-light interaction can also protect one-way propagation of single photons against backscattering. Our work opens a new door for studying nonreciprocal photonic band structure and exploring its applications in the quantum regime.},

We describe and analyze a method in which quantum operator-valued reflectivity can be used to control both spatio-temporal and quantum properties of transmitted and reflected light. Such a quantum metasurface is realized by preparing and manipulating entangled superposition states of atomically thin reflectors. Specifically, we show that such a system allows for massively parallel quantum operations between atoms and photons and for the generation of highly non-classical states of light, including photonic GHZ and cluster states suitable for quantum information processing. We analyze the influence of imperfections and decoherence, as well as specific implementations based on atom arrays excited into Rydberg states. Finally, the extension to quantum metamaterials and emulations of quantum gravitational background for light are discussed.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional regular arrays of atoms are a promising platform for quantum networks, with collective subradiant states providing long-lived storage and collimated emission allowing for natural coherent links between arrays in free space. However, a single-layer lattice can only efficiently absorb or emit light symmetrically in the forward and backward directions. Here we show how a bilayer lattice can absorb a single photon either incident from a single direction or an arbitrary superposition of forward and backward propagating components. The excitation can be stored in a subradiant state, transferred coherently between different subradiant states, and released, again in an arbitrary combination of highly collimated forward and backward propagating components. We explain the directionality of single and bilayer arrays by a symmetry analysis based on the scattering parities of different multipole radiation components of collective excitations. The collective modes may exhibit the conventional half-wave loss of fields near the array interface or completely eliminate it. The proposed directional control of absorption and emission paves the way for effective one-dimensional quantum communication between multiple arrays, with single-photons propagating backward and forward between quantum information-processing and storage stages.},

	abstract = {By analyzing the parameters of electronic transitions, we show how bosonic Sr atoms in planar optical lattices can be engineered to exhibit optical magnetism and other higher-order electromagnetic multipoles that can be harnessed for wavefront control of incident light. Resonant \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}simeq 2.6{\textbackslash}mu\$m light for the \${\textasciicircum}3D\_1{\textbackslash}rightarrow \{{\textasciicircum}3\}P\_0\$ transition mediates cooperative interactions between the atoms while the atoms are trapped in a deeply subwavelength optical lattice. The atoms then exhibit collective excitation eigenmodes, e.g., with a strong cooperative magnetic response at optical frequencies, despite individual atoms having negligible coupling to the magnetic component of light. We provide a detailed scheme to utilize excitations of such cooperative modes consisting of arrays of electromagnetic multipoles to form an atomic Huygens' surface, with complete \$2{\textbackslash}pi\$ phase control of transmitted light and almost no reflection, allowing nearly arbitrary wavefront shaping. In the numerical examples, this is achieved by controlling the atomic level shifts of Sr with off-resonant \$\{{\textasciicircum}3P\}\_J{\textbackslash}rightarrow \{{\textasciicircum}3D\}\_1\$ transitions, which results in a simultaneous excitation of arrays of electric dipoles and electric quadrupoles or magnetic dipoles. We demonstrate the wavefront engineering for a Sr array by realizing the steering of an incident beam and generation of a baby-Skyrmion texture in the transmitted light via a topologically nontrivial transition of a Gaussian beam to a Poincar{\textbackslash}'\{e\} beam, which contains all possible polarizations in a single cross-section.},

The strong interference effects in these systems generate subradiant excitations that propagate through the atomic array with very long lifetimes. Here, we demonstrate that one can harness these excitations to obtain tunable directional emission patterns and collective dissipative couplings when placing judiciously additional atoms nearby the atomic array. For doing that, we first characterize the optimal array geometry to obtain directional emission patterns. Then, we characterize the best atomic positions to couple efficiently to the subradiant metasurface excitations, and provide several improvement strategies based on entangled atomic clusters or bilayers. Afterwards, we also show how the directionality of the emission pattern can be controlled through the relative dipole orientation between the auxiliary atoms and the one of the array. Finally, we benchmark how these directional emission patterns translate into to collective, anisotropic dissipative couplings between the auxiliary atoms by studying the lifetime modification of atomic entangled states.},

In analogy with classical antenna arrays, this poses new opportunities for tailoring quantum interference effects by designing the geometry of the array. Here, we investigate the Nth-order directional correlation function of the photons emitted by an array of N initially-excited identical quantum emitters, addressing the impact of the appearance of grating lobes. Our analysis reveals that the absence of directivity in the ﬁrst-order correlation function is contrasted by an enhanced directivity in the Nth-order one. This suggests that the emitted light consists of a superposition of directionally entangled photon bunches. Moreover, the photon correlation landscape changes radically with the appearance of grating lobes. In fact, the photons no longer tend to be bunched along the same direction; rather, they are distributed in a set of correlated directions with equal probability. These results clarify basic aspects of light emission from ensembles of quantum emitters. Furthermore, they may ﬁnd applications in the design of nonclassical light sources.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Dicke superradiance is an example of emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence via correlated dissipation. Starting from an initially incoherent state, a collection of excited atoms synchronizes as they decay, generating a macroscopic dipole moment and emitting a short and intense pulse of light. While well understood in cavities, superradiance remains an open problem in extended systems due to the exponential growth of complexity with atom number. Here we show that Dicke superradiance is a universal phenomenon in ordered arrays. We present a theoretical framework – which circumvents the exponential complexity of the problem – that allows us to predict the critical distance beyond which Dicke superradiance disappears. This critical distance is highly dependent on the dimensionality and atom number. Our predictions can be tested in state of the art experiments with arrays of neutral atoms, molecules, and solid-state emitters and pave the way towards understanding the role of many-body decay in quantum simulation, metrology, and lasing.},

In this work, we explore the possibility of realizing largely nonreciprocal total cross sections for a pair of quantum metasurfaces formed by two parallel periodic arrays of twolevel atoms. We show that large nonreciprocal responses can be obtained in such nonlinear systems by controlling the position of the atoms and their transition frequencies, without requiring that the environment in which the atoms are placed is nonreciprocal. We demonstrate the connection of this effect with the asymmetric population of a slowly decaying dark state, which is critical to obtain large nonreciprocal responses.},

Here we predict a novel kind of bound quantum state in the simplest one-dimensional setup of two interacting particles in a box. Paradoxically, two entangled particles become localized at the opposite edges of the box even though their interactions at large distance should seemingly play no role. Such states could be realized in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics platform, where an array of superconducting qubits or cold atoms is coupled to a waveguide. We demonstrate how long-range waveguide-mediated couplings enable interaction-induced quantum states separated by large distances. Similarly to Majorana fermions in the Kitaev model, such bound state of distant photons is immune to short-range interactions and could find applications in robust quantum information processing.},

	abstract = {For a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide coupled to two or three qubits, we show that the photon-photon correlations have a wide variety of behavior, with structure that depends sensitively on the frequency and on the qubit-qubit separation L. We study the correlations by calculating the second-order correlation function g2(t) in which the interference among the photons multiply scattered from the qubits causes rich structure. In one case, for example, transmitted and reﬂected photons are both bunched initially, but then become strongly anti-bunched for a long time interval. We ﬁrst calculate the correlation function g2(t) including non-Markovian eﬀects and then show that a much simpler Markovian treatment, which can be solved analytically, is accurate for small qubit separation. As a result, the non-classical properties of microwaves in a 1D waveguide coupled to many superconducting qubits with experimentally accessible separation L could be readily explored with our approach.},
