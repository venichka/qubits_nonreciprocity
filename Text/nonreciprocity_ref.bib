	abstract = {Nonreciprocal devices such as isolators and circulators are key enabling technologies for communication systems, both at microwave and optical frequencies. While nonreciprocal devices based on magnetic effects are available for free-space and fibre-optic communication systems, their on-chip integration has been challenging, primarily due to the concomitant high insertion loss, weak magneto-optical effects, and material incompatibility. We show that Kerr nonlinear resonators can be used to achieve all-passive, low-loss, bias-free, broadband nonreciprocal transmission and routing for applications in photonic systems such as chip-scale LIDAR. A multi-port nonlinear Fano resonator is used as an on-chip, all-optical router for frequency comb based distance measurement. Since time-reversal symmetry imposes stringent limitations on the operating power range and transmission of a single nonlinear resonator, we implement a cascaded Fano-Lorentzian resonator system that overcomes these limitations and significantly improves the insertion loss, bandwidth and non-reciprocal power range of current state-of-the-art devices. This work provides a platform-independent design for nonreciprocal transmission and routing that are ideally suited for photonic integration.},

	abstract = {The control of individual quantum systems is now a reality in a variety of physical settings. Feedback control is an important class of control methods because of its ability to reduce the eﬀects of noise. In this review we give an introductory overview of the various ways in which feedback may be implemented in quantum systems, the theoretical methods that are currently used to treat it, the experiments in which it has been demonstrated to-date, and its applications. In the last few years there has been rapid experimental progress in the ability to realize quantum measurement and control of mesoscopic systems. We expect that the next few years will see further rapid advances in the precision and sophistication of feedback control protocols realized in the laboratory.},

We illustrate this effect in more detail for the example of cascaded two-level systems, where we present an explicit preparation scheme that allows one to tune the whole network through ‘bright’ and ‘dark’ states associated with different multi-partite entanglement patterns. In a complementary setting consisting of cascaded nonlinear cavities, we ﬁnd that two cavity modes can be driven into a non-Gaussian entangled dark state. Potential realizations of such cascaded networks with optical and microwave photons are discussed.},

Here we review recent progress in theory and experiment related to such quantum input-output networks, with a focus on the SLH framework, a powerful modeling framework for networked quantum systems that is naturally endowed with properties such as modularity and hierarchy. We begin by explaining the physical approximations required to represent any individual node of a network, e.g. atoms in cavity or a mechanical oscillator, and its coupling to quantum ﬁelds by an operator triple (S,L,H). Then we explain how these nodes can be composed into a network with arbitrary connectivity, including coherent feedback channels, using algebraic rules, and how to derive the dynamics of network components and output ﬁelds. The second part of the review discusses several extensions to the basic SLH framework that expand its modeling capabilities, and the prospects for modeling integrated implementations of quantum input-output networks. In addition to summarizing major results and recent literature, we discuss the potential applications and limitations of the SLH framework and quantum input-output networks, with the intention of providing context to a reader unfamiliar with the ﬁeld.},

We show how the concatenation and series products can be used to describe feedforward and feedback networks.

	abstract = {A quantum network is an open system consisting of several component Markovian input-output subsystems interconnected by boson ﬁeld channels carrying quantum stochastic signals. Generalizing the work of Chebotarev and Gregoratti, we formulate the model description by prescribing a candidate Hamiltonian for the network including details of the component systems, the ﬁeld channels, their interconnections, interactions and any time delays arising from the geometry of the network. (We show that the candidate is a symmetric operator and proceed modulo the proof of selfadjointness.) The model is non-Markovian for ﬁnite time delays, but in the limit where these delays vanish we recover a Markov model and thereby deduce the rules for introducing feedback into arbitrary quantum networks. The type of feedback considered includes that mediated by the use of beam splitters. We are therefore able to give a system-theoretic approach to introducing connections between quantum mechanical state-based input-output systems, and give a unifying treatment using non-commutative fractional linear, or Möbius, transformations.},

Our method takes into account the back-actions of the reservoirs, and enables us to calculate the exact dynamics of the complete system at all times. We show that such system can cause nonexponential and long-lived photon decay due to the existence of a relaxation eﬀect. The physical origin of non-Markovianity in our model system is the ﬁnite propagation speed resulting in time delays in communication between the nodes, and strong decay rate of the emitters into the waveguide. When the distance satisﬁes the standing wave condition, we ﬁnd that when the time delay is increased, the dark modes formation is no longer perfect, and the average photon number of dark mode decreases in steady time limit.},

The delay term is spatially non-local, rendering conventional approaches such as the method of lines inapplicable. We show that by properly designing the grid and by supplying the (partial) exact solution as the boundary condition, the delay PDE can be numerically solved. In addition, we demonstrate that while the delay imposes strong data dependency, multi-thread parallelization can nevertheless be applied to such a problem. Our code provides a numerically exact solution to the timedependent multi-photon scattering problem in waveguide QED.},

	abstract = {We develop a new computational tool and framework for characterizing the scattering of photons by energy-nonconserving Hamiltonians into unidirectional (chiral) waveguides, for example, with coherent pulsed excitation. The temporal waveguide modes are a natural basis for characterizing scattering in quantum optics, and afford a powerful technique based on a coarse discretization of time. This overcomes limitations imposed by singularities in the waveguide-system coupling. Moreover, the integrated discretized equations can be faithfully converted to a continuous-time result by taking the appropriate limit. This approach provides a complete solution to the scattered photon field in the waveguide, and can also be used to track system-waveguide entanglement during evolution. We further develop a direct connection between quantum measurement theory and evolution of the scattered field, demonstrating the correspondence between quantum trajectories and the scattered photon state. Our method is most applicable when the number of photons scattered is known to be small, i.e. for a single-photon or photon-pair source. We illustrate two examples: analytical solutions for short laser pulses scattering off a two-level system and numerically exact solutions for short laser pulses scattering off a spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) or spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) source. Finally, we note that our technique can easily be extended to systems with multiple ground states and generalized scattering problems with both finite photon number input and coherent state drive, potentially enhancing the understanding of, e.g., light-matter entanglement and photon phase gates.},

	abstract = {A promising approach to merge atomic systems with scalable photonics has emerged recently, which consists of trapping cold atoms near tapered nanoﬁbers. Here, we describe a novel technique to achieve strong, coherent coupling between a single atom and photon in such a system. Our approach makes use of collective enhancement effects, which allow a lattice of atoms to form a high-ﬁnesse cavity within the ﬁber. We show that a specially designated ‘impurity’ atom within the cavity can experience strongly enhanced interactions with single photons in the ﬁber. Under realistic conditions, a ‘strong coupling’ regime can be reached, wherein it becomes feasible to observe vacuum Rabi oscillations between the excited impurity atom and a single cavity quantum. This technique can form the basis for a scalable quantum information network using atom–nanoﬁber systems.},

This emerging field of superconducting quantum microwave circuits has been driven by many new interesting phenomena in microwave photonics and quantum information processing. For instance, the interaction between superconducting quantum circuits and single microwave photons can reach the regimes of strong, ultra-strong, and even deep-strong coupling. Many higher-order effects, unusual and less familiar in traditional cavity quantum electrodynamics with natural atoms, have been experimentally observed, e.g., giant Kerr effects, multi-photon processes, and single-atom induced bistability of microwave photons. These developments may lead to improved understanding of the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics, and speed up applications ranging from microwave photonics to superconducting quantum information processing. In this article, we review experimental and theoretical progress in microwave photonics with superconducting quantum circuits. We hope that this global review can provide a useful roadmap for this rapidly developing field.},

We demonstrate that photon bunching and anti-bunching persist much longer than both radiative and non-radiative lifetimes of a single qubit. The photon-photon correlations become immune to non-radiative dissipation due to the Borrmann effect, that is a strongly non-Markovian collective feature of light-qubit coupling inherent to the Bragg regime. This persistence of quantum correlations opens new avenues for enhancing the performance of setups of waveguide quantum electrodynamics.},

	abstract = {Breaking reciprocity is fundamentally important for the protection of sources from incoming signals and to route signals traveling in opposite directions asymmetrically. Nonreciprocal devices are usually realized through certain types of magnetic materials, such as ferrites, under biasing with a static magnetic field, but recently, there has also been interest in magnetless approaches, including spatiotemporal modulation and nonlinear effects. Here, we provide an overview of nonreciprocal devices realized through nonlinearities, which have the advantage of not requiring any sort of bias and therefore, being fully passive. We explain the operation principle of such devices focusing on the most common type, nonlinear isolators based on nonlinear Fano resonators. We show that, despite being able to achieve high isolation, these structures are subject to a tradeoff between forward transmission and isolation power range stemming from time-reversal symmetry. Next, we show how this tradeoff can be overcome in structures comprising multiple nonlinear resonators and provide an example at microwave frequencies. Finally, we discuss the limitations imposed by thermodynamics on the operation of nonlinear isolators when they are simultaneously excited from both sides, and we envision practical operations in which nonlinear isolators can be fundamentally useful.},

	abstract = {Optical nonlinearities can enable unusual light–matter interactions, with functionalities that would be otherwise inaccessible relying only on linear phenomena. Recently, several studies have harnessed the role of optical nonlinearities to implement nonreciprocal optical devices that do not require an external bias breaking time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we explore the design of a metasurface embedding Kerr nonlinearities to break reciprocity for free-space propagation, requiring limited power levels. After deriving the general design principles, we demonstrate an all-dielectric ﬂat metasurface made of coupled nonlinear Fano silicon resonant layers realizing large asymmetry in optical transmission at telecommunication frequencies. We show that the metrics of our design can go beyond the fundamental limitations on nonreciprocity for nonlinear optical devices based on a single resonance, as dictated by time-reversal symmetry considerations. Our work may shed light on the design of ﬂat subwavelength free-space nonreciprocal metasurface switches for pulsed operation which are easy to fabricate, fully passive, and require low operation power. Our simulated devices demonstrate a transmission ratio {\textgreater}50 dB for oppositely propagating waves, an operational bandwidth exceeding 600 GHz, and an insertion loss of {\textless}0.04 dB.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the potential of graphene nonreciprocal gyrotropy for microwave applications. First, the problem of a plane wave obliquely impinging on a graphene sheet is analyzed to provide physical insight into the fundamentals of graphene gyrotropy. It is found that graphene rotates the polarization of any plane wave impinging on it. The rotation angle is larger for H-polarized oblique waves than for normally incident waves and increases as the angle of incidence increases. The opposite holds for E waves. A general transmission matrix model is then developed for an arbitrary cylindrical waveguide and for a graphene sheet inside such a waveguide. This model is next applied to a circular cylindrical waveguide loaded with one or several graphene sheets and excited in its dominant H11 mode. Although the rotation angle from a single graphene sheet is quite high at high chemical potential, the corresponding transmission level is small due to the poor matching associated with the high density of the sheet. This fact prohibits the cascading of graphene sheets with high chemical potential as an approach to increase the amount of rotation. However, by decreasing the chemical potential, graphene may be well matched to waveguide modes, and therefore a large number of graphene sheets (ten in this study) may be used to produce a significant amount of rotation with relatively low insertion loss.},

Our method relies on a local gauge symmetry present in any Markovian Lindblad master equation. This new kind of quantum nonreciprocity has many implications, including a new mechanism for performing dissipatively-stabilized gate operations on a target quantum system.

            Many technologies emerging from quantum information science heavily rely upon the generation and manipulation of entangled quantum states. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new class of quantum interference phenomena that arise when states are created in and coherently converted between the propagating modes of an optical microcavity. The modal coupling introduces several new creation pathways to a nonlinear optical process within the device, which quantum mechanically interfere to drive the system between states in the time domain. The coherent conversion entangles the generated biphotons between propagation pathways, leading to cyclically evolving path-entanglement and the manifestation of coherent oscillations in second-order temporal correlations. Furthermore, the rich device physics is harnessed to tune properties of the quantum states. In particular, we show that the strength of interference between pathways can be coherently controlled, allowing for manipulation of the degree of entanglement, which can even be entirely quenched. The states can likewise be made to flip-flop between exhibiting initially correlated or uncorrelated behavior. The phenomena presented here open a route to creating higher dimensional entanglement and exotic multi-photon states.},

To overcome these challenges, we introduce an approach to quantum non-reciprocity, leveraging the inherent nonlinearity of qubits and spatial symmetry disruption. Our method transforms a circuit with Lorentz-type qubits into one with Fano-type qubits, which exhibit an asymmetric spectral response. This transformation leads to a signiﬁcant enhancement in isolation (up to 40 dB) and a doubling of spectral bandwidth (up to 200 MHz). We base our analysis on realistic circuit parameters and substantiate it with existing experimental results and comprehensive quantum simulations. Our research paves the way for creating compact, high-performance, planarcompatible non-reciprocal quantum devices.

Over the past twenty years, the ﬁeld has matured from a predominantly basic research endeavor to a one that increasingly explores the engineering of larger-scale superconducting quantum systems. Here, we review several foundational elements—qubit design, noise properties, qubit control, and readout techniques—developed during this period, bridging fundamental concepts in circuit quantum electrodynamics and contemporary, state-of-the-art applications in gate-model quantum computation.},

            Phonons, the ubiquitous quanta of vibrational energy, play a vital role in the performance of quantum technologies. Conversely, unintended coupling to phonons degrades qubit performance and can lead to correlated errors in superconducting qubit systems. Regardless of whether phonons play an enabling or deleterious role, they do not typically admit control over their spectral properties, nor the possibility of engineering their dissipation to be used as a resource. Here we show that coupling a superconducting qubit to a bath of piezoelectric surface acoustic wave phonons enables a novel platform for investigating open quantum systems. By shaping the loss spectrum of the qubit via the bath of lossy surface phonons, we demonstrate preparation and dynamical stabilization of superposition states through the combined effects of drive and dissipation. These experiments highlight the versatility of engineered phononic dissipation and advance the understanding of mechanical losses in superconducting qubit systems.},

This review, which is an updated and modernized version of a previous set of Les Houches School lecture notes, has three main parts. The first part describes how to construct a Hamiltonian for a general circuit, which can include dissipative elements. The second part describes the quantization of the circuit, with an emphasis on the quantum treatment of dissipation. The final part focuses on the Josephson nonlinear element and the main linear building blocks from which superconducting circuits are assembled. It also includes a brief review of the main types of superconducting artificial atoms, elementary multi-level quantum systems made from basic circuit elements.

	abstract = {With the introduction of superconducting circuits into the field of quantum optics, many novel experimental demonstrations of the quantum physics of an artificial atom coupled to a single-mode light field have been realized. Engineering such quantum systems offers the opportunity to explore extreme regimes of light-matter interaction that are inaccessible with natural systems. For instance the coupling strength \$g\$ can be increased until it is comparable with the atomic or mode frequency \${\textbackslash}omega\_\{a,m\}\$ and the atom can be coupled to multiple modes which has always challenged our understanding of light-matter interaction. Here, we experimentally realize the first Transmon qubit in the ultra-strong coupling regime, reaching coupling ratios of \$g/{\textbackslash}omega\_\{m\}=0.19\$ and we measure multi-mode interactions through a hybridization of the qubit up to the fifth mode of the resonator. This is enabled by a qubit with 88\% of its capacitance formed by a vacuum-gap capacitance with the center conductor of a coplanar waveguide resonator. In addition to potential applications in quantum information technologies due to its small size and localization of electric fields in vacuum, this new architecture offers the potential to further explore the novel regime of multi-mode ultra-strong coupling.},

	abstract = {Circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction of artificial atoms, open transmission lines and electromagnetic resonators fabricated from superconducting electronics. While the theory of an artificial atom coupled to one mode of a resonator is well studied, considering multiple modes leads to divergences which are not well understood. Here, we introduce a first-principles model of a multimode resonator coupled to a Josephson junction atom. Studying the model in the absence of any cutoff, in which the coupling rate to mode number \$n\$ scales as \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\$ for \$n\$ up to \${\textbackslash}infty\$, we find that quantities such as the Lamb shift do not diverge due to a natural rescaling of the bare atomic parameters that arises directly from the circuit analysis. Introducing a cutoff in the coupling from a non-zero capacitance of the Josephson junction, we provide a physical interpretation of the decoupling of higher modes in the context of circuit analysis. In addition to explaining the convergence of the quantum Rabi model with no cutoff, our work also provides a useful framework for analyzing the ultra-strong coupling regime of multimode circuit QED.},
