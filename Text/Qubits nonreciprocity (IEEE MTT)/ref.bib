	abstract = {Nonreciprocal devices such as isolators and circulators are key enabling technologies for communication systems, both at microwave and optical frequencies. While nonreciprocal devices based on magnetic effects are available for free-space and fibre-optic communication systems, their on-chip integration has been challenging, primarily due to the concomitant high insertion loss, weak magneto-optical effects, and material incompatibility. We show that Kerr nonlinear resonators can be used to achieve all-passive, low-loss, bias-free, broadband nonreciprocal transmission and routing for applications in photonic systems such as chip-scale LIDAR. A multi-port nonlinear Fano resonator is used as an on-chip, all-optical router for frequency comb based distance measurement. Since time-reversal symmetry imposes stringent limitations on the operating power range and transmission of a single nonlinear resonator, we implement a cascaded Fano-Lorentzian resonator system that overcomes these limitations and significantly improves the insertion loss, bandwidth and non-reciprocal power range of current state-of-the-art devices. This work provides a platform-independent design for nonreciprocal transmission and routing that are ideally suited for photonic integration.},

	abstract = {The control of individual quantum systems is now a reality in a variety of physical settings. Feedback control is an important class of control methods because of its ability to reduce the eﬀects of noise. In this review we give an introductory overview of the various ways in which feedback may be implemented in quantum systems, the theoretical methods that are currently used to treat it, the experiments in which it has been demonstrated to-date, and its applications. In the last few years there has been rapid experimental progress in the ability to realize quantum measurement and control of mesoscopic systems. We expect that the next few years will see further rapid advances in the precision and sophistication of feedback control protocols realized in the laboratory.},

We illustrate this effect in more detail for the example of cascaded two-level systems, where we present an explicit preparation scheme that allows one to tune the whole network through ‘bright’ and ‘dark’ states associated with different multi-partite entanglement patterns. In a complementary setting consisting of cascaded nonlinear cavities, we ﬁnd that two cavity modes can be driven into a non-Gaussian entangled dark state. Potential realizations of such cascaded networks with optical and microwave photons are discussed.},

Here we review recent progress in theory and experiment related to such quantum input-output networks, with a focus on the SLH framework, a powerful modeling framework for networked quantum systems that is naturally endowed with properties such as modularity and hierarchy. We begin by explaining the physical approximations required to represent any individual node of a network, e.g. atoms in cavity or a mechanical oscillator, and its coupling to quantum ﬁelds by an operator triple (S,L,H). Then we explain how these nodes can be composed into a network with arbitrary connectivity, including coherent feedback channels, using algebraic rules, and how to derive the dynamics of network components and output ﬁelds. The second part of the review discusses several extensions to the basic SLH framework that expand its modeling capabilities, and the prospects for modeling integrated implementations of quantum input-output networks. In addition to summarizing major results and recent literature, we discuss the potential applications and limitations of the SLH framework and quantum input-output networks, with the intention of providing context to a reader unfamiliar with the ﬁeld.},

We show how the concatenation and series products can be used to describe feedforward and feedback networks.

	abstract = {A quantum network is an open system consisting of several component Markovian input-output subsystems interconnected by boson ﬁeld channels carrying quantum stochastic signals. Generalizing the work of Chebotarev and Gregoratti, we formulate the model description by prescribing a candidate Hamiltonian for the network including details of the component systems, the ﬁeld channels, their interconnections, interactions and any time delays arising from the geometry of the network. (We show that the candidate is a symmetric operator and proceed modulo the proof of selfadjointness.) The model is non-Markovian for ﬁnite time delays, but in the limit where these delays vanish we recover a Markov model and thereby deduce the rules for introducing feedback into arbitrary quantum networks. The type of feedback considered includes that mediated by the use of beam splitters. We are therefore able to give a system-theoretic approach to introducing connections between quantum mechanical state-based input-output systems, and give a unifying treatment using non-commutative fractional linear, or Möbius, transformations.},

Our method takes into account the back-actions of the reservoirs, and enables us to calculate the exact dynamics of the complete system at all times. We show that such system can cause nonexponential and long-lived photon decay due to the existence of a relaxation eﬀect. The physical origin of non-Markovianity in our model system is the ﬁnite propagation speed resulting in time delays in communication between the nodes, and strong decay rate of the emitters into the waveguide. When the distance satisﬁes the standing wave condition, we ﬁnd that when the time delay is increased, the dark modes formation is no longer perfect, and the average photon number of dark mode decreases in steady time limit.},

The delay term is spatially non-local, rendering conventional approaches such as the method of lines inapplicable. We show that by properly designing the grid and by supplying the (partial) exact solution as the boundary condition, the delay PDE can be numerically solved. In addition, we demonstrate that while the delay imposes strong data dependency, multi-thread parallelization can nevertheless be applied to such a problem. Our code provides a numerically exact solution to the timedependent multi-photon scattering problem in waveguide QED.},

	abstract = {We develop a new computational tool and framework for characterizing the scattering of photons by energy-nonconserving Hamiltonians into unidirectional (chiral) waveguides, for example, with coherent pulsed excitation. The temporal waveguide modes are a natural basis for characterizing scattering in quantum optics, and afford a powerful technique based on a coarse discretization of time. This overcomes limitations imposed by singularities in the waveguide-system coupling. Moreover, the integrated discretized equations can be faithfully converted to a continuous-time result by taking the appropriate limit. This approach provides a complete solution to the scattered photon field in the waveguide, and can also be used to track system-waveguide entanglement during evolution. We further develop a direct connection between quantum measurement theory and evolution of the scattered field, demonstrating the correspondence between quantum trajectories and the scattered photon state. Our method is most applicable when the number of photons scattered is known to be small, i.e. for a single-photon or photon-pair source. We illustrate two examples: analytical solutions for short laser pulses scattering off a two-level system and numerically exact solutions for short laser pulses scattering off a spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) or spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) source. Finally, we note that our technique can easily be extended to systems with multiple ground states and generalized scattering problems with both finite photon number input and coherent state drive, potentially enhancing the understanding of, e.g., light-matter entanglement and photon phase gates.},

	abstract = {A promising approach to merge atomic systems with scalable photonics has emerged recently, which consists of trapping cold atoms near tapered nanoﬁbers. Here, we describe a novel technique to achieve strong, coherent coupling between a single atom and photon in such a system. Our approach makes use of collective enhancement effects, which allow a lattice of atoms to form a high-ﬁnesse cavity within the ﬁber. We show that a specially designated ‘impurity’ atom within the cavity can experience strongly enhanced interactions with single photons in the ﬁber. Under realistic conditions, a ‘strong coupling’ regime can be reached, wherein it becomes feasible to observe vacuum Rabi oscillations between the excited impurity atom and a single cavity quantum. This technique can form the basis for a scalable quantum information network using atom–nanoﬁber systems.},

This emerging field of superconducting quantum microwave circuits has been driven by many new interesting phenomena in microwave photonics and quantum information processing. For instance, the interaction between superconducting quantum circuits and single microwave photons can reach the regimes of strong, ultra-strong, and even deep-strong coupling. Many higher-order effects, unusual and less familiar in traditional cavity quantum electrodynamics with natural atoms, have been experimentally observed, e.g., giant Kerr effects, multi-photon processes, and single-atom induced bistability of microwave photons. These developments may lead to improved understanding of the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics, and speed up applications ranging from microwave photonics to superconducting quantum information processing. In this article, we review experimental and theoretical progress in microwave photonics with superconducting quantum circuits. We hope that this global review can provide a useful roadmap for this rapidly developing field.},

We demonstrate that photon bunching and anti-bunching persist much longer than both radiative and non-radiative lifetimes of a single qubit. The photon-photon correlations become immune to non-radiative dissipation due to the Borrmann effect, that is a strongly non-Markovian collective feature of light-qubit coupling inherent to the Bragg regime. This persistence of quantum correlations opens new avenues for enhancing the performance of setups of waveguide quantum electrodynamics.},

	abstract = {Breaking reciprocity is fundamentally important for the protection of sources from incoming signals and to route signals traveling in opposite directions asymmetrically. Nonreciprocal devices are usually realized through certain types of magnetic materials, such as ferrites, under biasing with a static magnetic field, but recently, there has also been interest in magnetless approaches, including spatiotemporal modulation and nonlinear effects. Here, we provide an overview of nonreciprocal devices realized through nonlinearities, which have the advantage of not requiring any sort of bias and therefore, being fully passive. We explain the operation principle of such devices focusing on the most common type, nonlinear isolators based on nonlinear Fano resonators. We show that, despite being able to achieve high isolation, these structures are subject to a tradeoff between forward transmission and isolation power range stemming from time-reversal symmetry. Next, we show how this tradeoff can be overcome in structures comprising multiple nonlinear resonators and provide an example at microwave frequencies. Finally, we discuss the limitations imposed by thermodynamics on the operation of nonlinear isolators when they are simultaneously excited from both sides, and we envision practical operations in which nonlinear isolators can be fundamentally useful.},

	abstract = {Optical nonlinearities can enable unusual light–matter interactions, with functionalities that would be otherwise inaccessible relying only on linear phenomena. Recently, several studies have harnessed the role of optical nonlinearities to implement nonreciprocal optical devices that do not require an external bias breaking time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we explore the design of a metasurface embedding Kerr nonlinearities to break reciprocity for free-space propagation, requiring limited power levels. After deriving the general design principles, we demonstrate an all-dielectric ﬂat metasurface made of coupled nonlinear Fano silicon resonant layers realizing large asymmetry in optical transmission at telecommunication frequencies. We show that the metrics of our design can go beyond the fundamental limitations on nonreciprocity for nonlinear optical devices based on a single resonance, as dictated by time-reversal symmetry considerations. Our work may shed light on the design of ﬂat subwavelength free-space nonreciprocal metasurface switches for pulsed operation which are easy to fabricate, fully passive, and require low operation power. Our simulated devices demonstrate a transmission ratio {\textgreater}50 dB for oppositely propagating waves, an operational bandwidth exceeding 600 GHz, and an insertion loss of {\textless}0.04 dB.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the potential of graphene nonreciprocal gyrotropy for microwave applications. First, the problem of a plane wave obliquely impinging on a graphene sheet is analyzed to provide physical insight into the fundamentals of graphene gyrotropy. It is found that graphene rotates the polarization of any plane wave impinging on it. The rotation angle is larger for H-polarized oblique waves than for normally incident waves and increases as the angle of incidence increases. The opposite holds for E waves. A general transmission matrix model is then developed for an arbitrary cylindrical waveguide and for a graphene sheet inside such a waveguide. This model is next applied to a circular cylindrical waveguide loaded with one or several graphene sheets and excited in its dominant H11 mode. Although the rotation angle from a single graphene sheet is quite high at high chemical potential, the corresponding transmission level is small due to the poor matching associated with the high density of the sheet. This fact prohibits the cascading of graphene sheets with high chemical potential as an approach to increase the amount of rotation. However, by decreasing the chemical potential, graphene may be well matched to waveguide modes, and therefore a large number of graphene sheets (ten in this study) may be used to produce a significant amount of rotation with relatively low insertion loss.},

Our method relies on a local gauge symmetry present in any Markovian Lindblad master equation. This new kind of quantum nonreciprocity has many implications, including a new mechanism for performing dissipatively-stabilized gate operations on a target quantum system.

            Many technologies emerging from quantum information science heavily rely upon the generation and manipulation of entangled quantum states. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new class of quantum interference phenomena that arise when states are created in and coherently converted between the propagating modes of an optical microcavity. The modal coupling introduces several new creation pathways to a nonlinear optical process within the device, which quantum mechanically interfere to drive the system between states in the time domain. The coherent conversion entangles the generated biphotons between propagation pathways, leading to cyclically evolving path-entanglement and the manifestation of coherent oscillations in second-order temporal correlations. Furthermore, the rich device physics is harnessed to tune properties of the quantum states. In particular, we show that the strength of interference between pathways can be coherently controlled, allowing for manipulation of the degree of entanglement, which can even be entirely quenched. The states can likewise be made to flip-flop between exhibiting initially correlated or uncorrelated behavior. The phenomena presented here open a route to creating higher dimensional entanglement and exotic multi-photon states.},

To overcome these challenges, we introduce an approach to quantum non-reciprocity, leveraging the inherent nonlinearity of qubits and spatial symmetry disruption. Our method transforms a circuit with Lorentz-type qubits into one with Fano-type qubits, which exhibit an asymmetric spectral response. This transformation leads to a signiﬁcant enhancement in isolation (up to 40 dB) and a doubling of spectral bandwidth (up to 200 MHz). We base our analysis on realistic circuit parameters and substantiate it with existing experimental results and comprehensive quantum simulations. Our research paves the way for creating compact, high-performance, planarcompatible non-reciprocal quantum devices.

            Phonons, the ubiquitous quanta of vibrational energy, play a vital role in the performance of quantum technologies. Conversely, unintended coupling to phonons degrades qubit performance and can lead to correlated errors in superconducting qubit systems. Regardless of whether phonons play an enabling or deleterious role, they do not typically admit control over their spectral properties, nor the possibility of engineering their dissipation to be used as a resource. Here we show that coupling a superconducting qubit to a bath of piezoelectric surface acoustic wave phonons enables a novel platform for investigating open quantum systems. By shaping the loss spectrum of the qubit via the bath of lossy surface phonons, we demonstrate preparation and dynamical stabilization of superposition states through the combined effects of drive and dissipation. These experiments highlight the versatility of engineered phononic dissipation and advance the understanding of mechanical losses in superconducting qubit systems.},

	abstract = {With the introduction of superconducting circuits into the field of quantum optics, many novel experimental demonstrations of the quantum physics of an artificial atom coupled to a single-mode light field have been realized. Engineering such quantum systems offers the opportunity to explore extreme regimes of light-matter interaction that are inaccessible with natural systems. For instance the coupling strength \$g\$ can be increased until it is comparable with the atomic or mode frequency \${\textbackslash}omega\_\{a,m\}\$ and the atom can be coupled to multiple modes which has always challenged our understanding of light-matter interaction. Here, we experimentally realize the first Transmon qubit in the ultra-strong coupling regime, reaching coupling ratios of \$g/{\textbackslash}omega\_\{m\}=0.19\$ and we measure multi-mode interactions through a hybridization of the qubit up to the fifth mode of the resonator. This is enabled by a qubit with 88\% of its capacitance formed by a vacuum-gap capacitance with the center conductor of a coplanar waveguide resonator. In addition to potential applications in quantum information technologies due to its small size and localization of electric fields in vacuum, this new architecture offers the potential to further explore the novel regime of multi-mode ultra-strong coupling.},

While the theory of an artificial atom coupled to one mode of a resonator is well studied, considering multiple modes leads to divergences which are not well understood. Here, we introduce a first-principles model of a multimode resonator coupled to a Josephson junction atom. Studying the model in the absence of any cutoff, in which the coupling rate to mode number \$n\$ scales as \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\$ for \$n\$ up to \${\textbackslash}infty\$, we find that quantities such as the Lamb shift do not diverge due to a natural rescaling of the bare atomic parameters that arises directly from the circuit analysis. Introducing a cutoff in the coupling from a non-zero capacitance of the Josephson junction, we provide a physical interpretation of the decoupling of higher modes in the context of circuit analysis. In addition to explaining the convergence of the quantum Rabi model with no cutoff, our work also provides a useful framework for analyzing the ultra-strong coupling regime of multimode circuit QED.},

Here, we describe a novel technique to achieve strong, coherent coupling between a single atom and photon in such a system. Our approach makes use of collective enhancement effects, which allow a lattice of atoms to form a high-ﬁnesse cavity within the ﬁber. We show that a specially designated ‘impurity’ atom within the cavity can experience strongly enhanced interactions with single photons in the ﬁber. Under realistic conditions, a ‘strong coupling’ regime can be reached, wherein it becomes feasible to observe vacuum Rabi oscillations between the excited impurity atom and a single cavity quantum. This technique can form the basis for a scalable quantum information network using atom–nanoﬁber systems.},

            Understanding strong cooperative optical responses in dense and cold atomic ensembles is vital for fundamental science and emerging quantum technologies. Methodologies for characterizing light-induced quantum effects in such systems, however, are still lacking. Here we unambiguously identify significant quantum many-body effects, robust to position fluctuations and strong dipole–dipole interactions, in light scattered from planar atomic ensembles by comparing full quantum simulations with a semiclassical model neglecting quantum fluctuations. We find pronounced quantum effects at high atomic densities, light close to saturation intensity, and around subradiant resonances. Such conditions also maximize spin–spin correlations and entanglement between atoms, revealing the microscopic origin of light-induced quantum effects. In several regimes of interest, our approximate model reproduces light transmission remarkably well, permitting analysis of otherwise numerically inaccessible large ensembles, in which we observe many-body analogues of resonance power broadening, vacuum Rabi splitting, and significant suppression in cooperative reflection from atomic arrays.},

In this work, motivated by the recent experiment [1], we develop a microscopic quantum treatment using annihilation and creation operator of atoms in deep optical lattices. Using a diagrammatic approach on the Keldysh contour, we derive the cooperative scattering of the light and obtain the general formula for the S matrix. We apply our formulism to study two eﬀects beyond previous treatment with spin operators, the eﬀect of fractional ﬁlling and trapping mismatch. Both eﬀects can lead to the imperfectness of atomic mirrors. For the fractional ﬁlling case, we ﬁnd the cooperative linewidth is linear in ﬁlling fraction n. When there is a mismatch between the trapping potentials for atoms in the ground state and the excited state, multiple resonances can appear in the response function. Our results are consistent with existing experiments.},

In this review article we survey recent theoretical studies concerning the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to create quantum many-body systems. Based on recent experimental progress in the fabrication of arrays of interacting micro-cavities and on their coupling to atomic-like structures in several different physical architectures, we review proposals on the realisation of paradigmatic many-body models in such systems, such as the Bose-Hubbard and the anisotropic Heisenberg models. Such arrays of coupled cavities offer interesting properties as simulators of quantum many-body physics, including the full addressability of individual sites and the accessibility of inhomogeneous models.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new theoretical approach for analyzing pump and probe experiments in non-linear acousto-optic systems. In our approach, the effect of coherently pumped polaritons is modeled as providing time-periodic modulation of the system parameters. Within this framework, propagation of the probe pulse is described by the Floquet version of Maxwell's equations and leads to such phenomena as frequency mixing and resonant parametric production of polariton pairs. We analyze light reflection from a slab of insulating material with a strongly excited phonon-polariton mode and obtain analytic expressions for the frequency-dependent reflection coefficient for the probe pulse. Our results are in agreement with recent experiments by Cartella et al. which demonstrated light amplification in resonantly excited SiC insulator. We show that, beyond a critical pumping strength, such systems should exhibit Floquet parametric instability, which corresponds to resonant scattering of the pump polaritons into pairs of finite momentum polaritons. We find that the parametric instability should be achievable in SiC using current experimental techniques and discuss its signatures, including the non-analytic frequency dependence of the reflection coefficient and the probe pulse afterglow. We discuss possible applications of the parametric instability phenomenon and suggest that similar types of instabilities can be present in other photoexcited non-linear systems.},

This effect reflects the amplification of light by phonon-mediated four-wave mixing and, by extension, of optical-phonon fluctuations. Density functional theory calculations clarify aspects of the microscopic mechanism for this phenomenon. The high-frequency dielectric permittivity and the phonon oscillator strength depend quadratically on the lattice coordinate; they oscillate at twice the frequency of the optical field and provide a parametric drive for the lattice mode. Parametric gain in phononic four-wave mixing is a generic mechanism that can be extended to all polar modes of solids, as a means to control the kinetics of phase transitions, to amplify many-body interactions or to control phonon-polariton waves.},

	abstract = {Optical drives at terahertz and mid-infrared frequencies in quantum materials are increasingly used to reveal the nonlinear dynamics of collective modes in correlated many-body systems and their interplay with electromagnetic waves. Recent experiments demonstrated several surprising optical properties of transient states induced by driving, including the appearance of photo-induced edges in the reflectivity in cuprate superconductors, observed both below and above the equilibrium transition temperature. Furthermore, in other driven materials, reflection coefficients larger than unity have been observed. In this paper we demonstrate that unusual optical properties of photoexcited systems can be understood from the perspective of a Floquet system; a system with periodically modulated system parameters originating from pump-induced oscillations of a collective mode. We present a general phenomenological model of reflectivity from Floquet materials, which takes into account parametric generation of excitation pairs. We find a universal phase diagram of drive induced features in reflectivity which evidence a competition between driving and dissipation. To illustrate our general analysis we apply our formalism to two concrete examples motivated by recent experiments: a single plasmon band, which describes Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors, and a phonon-polariton system, which describes upper and lower polaritons in materials such as insulating SiC. Finally we demonstrate that our model can be used to provide an accurate fit to results of phonon-pump - terahertz-probe experiments in the high temperature superconductor \${\textbackslash}rm\{YBa\_2Cu\_3O\_\{6.5\}\}\$. Our model explains the appearance of a pump-induced edge, which is higher in energy than the equilibrium Josephson plasmon edge, even if the interlayer Josephson coupling is suppressed by the pump pulse.},

The theory generalises the standard mode expansion of the electromagnetic fields in free space to allow for the presence of absorbing bodies. We show that macroscopic quantum electrodynamics provides the link between isolated atomic systems and magnetoelectric bodies, and serves as an important tool for the understanding of surface-assisted atomic relaxation effects and the intimately connected position-dependent energy shifts which give rise to Casimir-Polder and van der Waals forces.},

	abstract = {Significance
            In recent years, there has been considerable effort to bring ultracold atoms into the realm of nanophotonics. Nanoscopic dielectric devices offer unprecedented opportunities to engineer novel capabilities for the control of atom–photon interactions. In particular, photonic crystals are periodic dielectric structures that display a photonic bandgap where light cannot propagate and provide a new setting for coherent photon-mediated interactions between atoms with tunable range. Here, we report the initial observation of cooperative atom–atom interactions around the band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide. Our experiment opens the door to fascinating scenarios, such as exploring many-body physics with large spin exchange energies and low dissipation.
          , 
            
              Tailoring the interactions between quantum emitters and single photons constitutes one of the cornerstones of quantum optics. Coupling a quantum emitter to the band edge of a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) provides a unique platform for tuning these interactions. In particular, the cross-over from propagating fields

Such a trend has inevitably aﬀected the research funding market; thus, large state initiatives are taken that are directly expected to drive the formulation of novel research concepts and the development of quantum device prototypes from sensors and circuitry to quantum memory and repeaters. A fundamental operation behind all these applications is the eﬀective steering of electrons, constituting matter waves, along speciﬁc directions and with certain magnitudes, due to development of various reﬂective and refractive orders. The objective of this study is to optimize the simplest structure that supports such anomalous diﬀraction, namely a quantum metasurface comprising cylindrical rods embedded in suitable crystalline matter. Several highly-performing designs from these minimal setups are proven to work exceptionally as multiport components, employable to a variety of quantum engineering implementations.},

Analyzing their interplay, we identify conditions that yield a nonlinear quantum mirror which coherently splits incident fields into correlated photon-pairs in a single transverse mode, while transmitting single photons unaffected. Such strong photon-photon interactions in the absence of otherwise detrimental photon losses in Rydberg-EIT arrays opens up a promising approach for the generation and manipulation of quantum light, and the exploration of many-body phenomena with interacting photons.},

            Efficient manipulation of quantum states is a key step towards applications in quantum information, quantum metrology, and nonlinear optics. Recently, atomic arrays have been shown to be a promising system for exploring topological quantum optics and robust control of quantum states, where the inherent nonlinearity is included through long-range hoppings. Here we show that a one-dimensional atomic array in a periodic magnetic field exhibits characteristic properties associated with an effective two-dimensional Hofstadter-butterfly-like model. Our work points out super- and sub-radiant topological edge states localized at the boundaries of the atomic array despite featuring long-range interactions, and opens an avenue of exploring an interacting quantum optical platform with synthetic dimensions.},

The chiral interaction between the resonator mode and the QE can break the time-reversal symmetry without the magneto-optical effect. As a result, a nonreciprocal single-photon edge state, band gap and flat band appear. By using such a chiral QE-CROW system, including a finite number of unit cells and working in the nonreciprocal band gap, we achieve frequency-multiplex single-photon circulators with high fidelity and low insertion loss. The chiral QE-light interaction can also protect one-way propagation of single photons against backscattering. Our work opens a new door for studying nonreciprocal photonic band structure and exploring its applications in the quantum regime.},

Specifically, we show that such a system allows for massively parallel quantum operations between atoms and photons and for the generation of highly non-classical states of light, including photonic GHZ and cluster states suitable for quantum information processing. We analyze the influence of imperfections and decoherence, as well as specific implementations based on atom arrays excited into Rydberg states.

However, a single-layer lattice can only efficiently absorb or emit light symmetrically in the forward and backward directions. Here we show how a bilayer lattice can absorb a single photon either incident from a single direction or an arbitrary superposition of forward and backward propagating components. The excitation can be stored in a subradiant state, transferred coherently between different subradiant states, and released, again in an arbitrary combination of highly collimated forward and backward propagating components. We explain the directionality of single and bilayer arrays by a symmetry analysis based on the scattering parities of different multipole radiation components of collective excitations. The collective modes may exhibit the conventional half-wave loss of fields near the array interface or completely eliminate it. The proposed directional control of absorption and emission paves the way for effective one-dimensional quantum communication between multiple arrays, with single-photons propagating backward and forward between quantum information-processing and storage stages.},

	abstract = {By analyzing the parameters of electronic transitions, we show how bosonic Sr atoms in planar optical lattices can be engineered to exhibit optical magnetism and other higher-order electromagnetic multipoles that can be harnessed for wavefront control of incident light. Resonant \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}simeq 2.6{\textbackslash}mu\$m light for the \${\textasciicircum}3D\_1{\textbackslash}rightarrow \{{\textasciicircum}3\}P\_0\$ transition mediates cooperative interactions between the atoms while the atoms are trapped in a deeply subwavelength optical lattice. The atoms then exhibit collective excitation eigenmodes, e.g., with a strong cooperative magnetic response at optical frequencies, despite individual atoms having negligible coupling to the magnetic component of light. We provide a detailed scheme to utilize excitations of such cooperative modes consisting of arrays of electromagnetic multipoles to form an atomic Huygens' surface, with complete \$2{\textbackslash}pi\$ phase control of transmitted light and almost no reflection, allowing nearly arbitrary wavefront shaping. In the numerical examples, this is achieved by controlling the atomic level shifts of Sr with off-resonant \$\{{\textasciicircum}3P\}\_J{\textbackslash}rightarrow \{{\textasciicircum}3D\}\_1\$ transitions, which results in a simultaneous excitation of arrays of electric dipoles and electric quadrupoles or magnetic dipoles. We demonstrate the wavefront engineering for a Sr array by realizing the steering of an incident beam and generation of a baby-Skyrmion texture in the transmitted light via a topologically nontrivial transition of a Gaussian beam to a Poincar{\textbackslash}'\{e\} beam, which contains all possible polarizations in a single cross-section.},

The strong interference effects in these systems generate subradiant excitations that propagate through the atomic array with very long lifetimes. Here, we demonstrate that one can harness these excitations to obtain tunable directional emission patterns and collective dissipative couplings when placing judiciously additional atoms nearby the atomic array. For doing that, we first characterize the optimal array geometry to obtain directional emission patterns. Then, we characterize the best atomic positions to couple efficiently to the subradiant metasurface excitations, and provide several improvement strategies based on entangled atomic clusters or bilayers. Afterwards, we also show how the directionality of the emission pattern can be controlled through the relative dipole orientation between the auxiliary atoms and the one of the array. Finally, we benchmark how these directional emission patterns translate into to collective, anisotropic dissipative couplings between the auxiliary atoms by studying the lifetime modification of atomic entangled states.},

In analogy with classical antenna arrays, this poses new opportunities for tailoring quantum interference effects by designing the geometry of the array. Here, we investigate the Nth-order directional correlation function of the photons emitted by an array of N initially-excited identical quantum emitters, addressing the impact of the appearance of grating lobes. Our analysis reveals that the absence of directivity in the ﬁrst-order correlation function is contrasted by an enhanced directivity in the Nth-order one. This suggests that the emitted light consists of a superposition of directionally entangled photon bunches. Moreover, the photon correlation landscape changes radically with the appearance of grating lobes. In fact, the photons no longer tend to be bunched along the same direction; rather, they are distributed in a set of correlated directions with equal probability. These results clarify basic aspects of light emission from ensembles of quantum emitters. Furthermore, they may ﬁnd applications in the design of nonclassical light sources.},

            Dicke superradiance is an example of emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence via correlated dissipation. Starting from an initially incoherent state, a collection of excited atoms synchronizes as they decay, generating a macroscopic dipole moment and emitting a short and intense pulse of light. While well understood in cavities, superradiance remains an open problem in extended systems due to the exponential growth of complexity with atom number. Here we show that Dicke superradiance is a universal phenomenon in ordered arrays. We present a theoretical framework – which circumvents the exponential complexity of the problem – that allows us to predict the critical distance beyond which Dicke superradiance disappears. This critical distance is highly dependent on the dimensionality and atom number. Our predictions can be tested in state of the art experiments with arrays of neutral atoms, molecules, and solid-state emitters and pave the way towards understanding the role of many-body decay in quantum simulation, metrology, and lasing.},

In this work, we explore the possibility of realizing largely nonreciprocal total cross sections for a pair of quantum metasurfaces formed by two parallel periodic arrays of twolevel atoms. We show that large nonreciprocal responses can be obtained in such nonlinear systems by controlling the position of the atoms and their transition frequencies, without requiring that the environment in which the atoms are placed is nonreciprocal. We demonstrate the connection of this effect with the asymmetric population of a slowly decaying dark state, which is critical to obtain large nonreciprocal responses.},

Here we predict a novel kind of bound quantum state in the simplest one-dimensional setup of two interacting particles in a box. Paradoxically, two entangled particles become localized at the opposite edges of the box even though their interactions at large distance should seemingly play no role. Such states could be realized in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics platform, where an array of superconducting qubits or cold atoms is coupled to a waveguide. We demonstrate how long-range waveguide-mediated couplings enable interaction-induced quantum states separated by large distances. Similarly to Majorana fermions in the Kitaev model, such bound state of distant photons is immune to short-range interactions and could find applications in robust quantum information processing.},

	abstract = {For a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide coupled to two or three qubits, we show that the photon-photon correlations have a wide variety of behavior, with structure that depends sensitively on the frequency and on the qubit-qubit separation L. We study the correlations by calculating the second-order correlation function g2(t) in which the interference among the photons multiply scattered from the qubits causes rich structure. In one case, for example, transmitted and reﬂected photons are both bunched initially, but then become strongly anti-bunched for a long time interval. We ﬁrst calculate the correlation function g2(t) including non-Markovian eﬀects and then show that a much simpler Markovian treatment, which can be solved analytically, is accurate for small qubit separation. As a result, the non-classical properties of microwaves in a 1D waveguide coupled to many superconducting qubits with experimentally accessible separation L could be readily explored with our approach.},
